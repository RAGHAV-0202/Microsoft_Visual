// there are two types of graphs , directed and undirected
// circular are called nodes / vertex and represented by number , like node 1 , 2 ,3 : no specific order
// nodes are connected by line called edge

//      O----O

// directed graph

// two subtypes : cyclic and acylic

// path : contains a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable

// degree of node = edges attached

// total degree = 2 * edges
